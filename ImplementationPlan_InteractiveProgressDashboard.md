# Implementation Plan: Interactive Progress Dashboard

## Objective
To create an Interactive Progress Dashboard linked from the Reports dropdown. The dashboard will minimize data entry by utilizing existing data for metrics such as:
- Number of workouts per time perdiod
- Sets and reps
- Calculated volume
- Calories burned

Additionally, we will suggest and implement other useful metrics that may require additional input.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard Design
- **Interactive UI**: Use Razor Pages with Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive and visually appealing dashboard.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Plotly.js) to display metrics interactively.
- **Filters**: Allow users to filter data by date range, workout type, or other relevant criteria.
- **Export Options**: Provide options to export data as CSV or PDF.

### 2. Metrics to Display
- **Existing Metrics**:
  - Number of workouts
  - Sets and reps
  - Calculated volume
  - Calories burned
- **Additional Metrics** (may require user input):
  - Average workout duration
  - Personal bests (e.g., max weight lifted, fastest time)
  - Progress towards goals (e.g., weight loss, strength gain)
  - Heart rate trends (if data is available)

### 3. Data Utilization
- **Minimize Data Entry**: Leverage existing data from the database to populate the dashboard.
- **Data Aggregation**: Use the service layer to aggregate data efficiently.
- **Caching**: Utilize the existing output cache to improve performance.

### 4. User Experience Enhancements
- **Tooltips**: Add tooltips to explain metrics and provide additional context.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Ensure compatibility with the existing dark mode feature.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the dashboard is fully functional on mobile devices.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Automated Planning and Design
1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - Use semantic search to identify existing models, services, and repositories for reusable components.
   - Perform a gap analysis on data for additional metrics using existing database schemas and service layers.
2. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Generate wireframes programmatically using a design tool or library.
   - Define layout and interaction flow based on existing Razor Pages structure.

### Phase 2: Automated Backend Development
1. **Data Access**:
   - Extend existing repositories and services by programmatically generating methods to fetch required data.
   - Use semantic search to identify and integrate with existing caching mechanisms.
2. **Caching**:
   - Automate integration with the existing caching structure to optimize data retrieval.

### Phase 3: Automated Frontend Development
1. **Razor Pages**:
   - Generate a new Razor Page for the dashboard using templates.
   - Apply Bootstrap 5 styling programmatically.
2. **Charts and Graphs**:
   - Integrate a charting library by automating the setup and binding data dynamically to charts.
3. **Filters and Export**:
   - Add filtering options and export functionality using pre-built components or libraries.

### Phase 4: Automated Testing and Deployment
1. **Testing**:
   - Use automated testing tools to perform unit and integration testing for backend changes.
   - Conduct UI testing using tools like Selenium or Playwright for responsiveness and usability.
2. **Deployment**:
   - Update the Reports dropdown programmatically to link to the new dashboard.
   - Automate deployment to the staging environment for user feedback.

## Suggestions for Future Enhancements
- **Gamification**: Add badges or achievements for reaching milestones.
- **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share progress on social media.
- **Integration with Wearables**: Sync data from fitness trackers for additional metrics.
- **AI Insights**: Use machine learning to provide personalized recommendations.

---

## Documentation Updates
- Update `README.md` with details about the new dashboard.
- Update `inventory.md` to include new files and components.
- Update `SoW.md` to reflect the completed work.

---

## Notes
- Ensure all code and configuration are compatible with Linux containers.
- Follow the existing coding and architectural guidelines strictly.
- Use the existing logging framework for debugging and monitoring.

---

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Planning and Design
- **Week 2-3**: Backend Development
- **Week 4-5**: Frontend Development
- **Week 6**: Testing and Deployment

---

## Dependencies
- Charting library (e.g., Chart.js or Plotly.js)
- Existing service and repository layers
- Bootstrap 5

---

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Data Gaps**: Identify missing data early and plan for user input where necessary.
- **Performance Issues**: Use caching and efficient queries to handle large datasets.
- **UI Compatibility**: Test thoroughly on different devices and browsers.

---

## Approval
- This plan requires approval from the project stakeholders before implementation begins.
