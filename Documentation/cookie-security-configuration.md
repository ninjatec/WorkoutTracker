# Cookie Security Configuration

## Overview

This document explains the cookie security measures implemented in WorkoutTracker to address DAST findings regarding cookies missing HttpOnly flags.

## Security Challenge

DAST tools identified that the CSRF token cookie has `HttpOnly = false`, which is flagged as a security vulnerability. However, this is a necessary configuration for anti-forgery protection in AJAX-heavy applications.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Cookie Configuration Enhancements

#### Authentication Cookie (`__Host-WorkoutTracker.Auth`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements

#### Session Cookie (`__Host-WorkoutTracker.Session`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements

#### CSRF Token Cookie (`__Host-CSRF-TOKEN`)
- **HttpOnly**: `false` - **Required for JavaScript access in AJAX requests**
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements
- **Expiration**: 12 hours - Minimizes exposure window

### 2. Cookie Prefix Security

The `__Host-` prefix provides additional security guarantees:
- Cookie must be sent over HTTPS
- Cookie must have the `Secure` flag set
- Cookie must not have a `Domain` attribute
- Cookie must have a `Path` attribute with the value `/`

### 3. Mitigating Controls for CSRF Token Exposure

While the CSRF token must be accessible to JavaScript, we implement multiple layers of protection:

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict script sources to prevent malicious script injection
- No `'unsafe-eval'` to prevent dynamic code execution
- Restricted inline scripts to minimize XSS attack surface

#### Additional Security Headers
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Legacy browser XSS protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: `SAMEORIGIN` - Prevents clickjacking
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

#### Cache Control for Sensitive Pages
- Authentication pages have strict cache control
- Prevents sensitive data from being cached
- Reduces token exposure in browser cache

### 4. Rate Limiting Cookie

The rate limiting cookie is properly secured:
- **HttpOnly**: `true`
- **SameSite**: `Lax`
- **Secure**: Based on environment
- **IsEssential**: `true`

## Risk Assessment

### Remaining Risk: CSRF Token JavaScript Access

**Risk**: The CSRF token cookie is accessible via JavaScript (`HttpOnly = false`)
**Justification**: Required for anti-forgery protection in AJAX requests
**Mitigations**:
1. Strict Content Security Policy prevents malicious script execution
2. SameSite=Strict prevents cross-site request forgery
3. Secure flag ensures HTTPS-only transmission
4. Short expiration (12 hours) minimizes exposure window
5. `__Host-` prefix provides additional security guarantees

### Security Trade-off Analysis

The decision to keep `HttpOnly = false` for CSRF tokens is a calculated security trade-off:

**Benefits**:
- Enables robust anti-forgery protection for AJAX requests
- Prevents CSRF attacks (more common and easier to exploit)
- Maintains application functionality

**Costs**:
- Potential XSS exploitation of CSRF token
- Requires multiple mitigating controls

**Conclusion**: The anti-forgery protection benefits outweigh the XSS risks, especially with comprehensive mitigations in place.

## Compliance Notes

### DAST Tool Findings

DAST tools may continue to flag the CSRF token cookie as missing HttpOnly. This is expected and acceptable given:

1. The security requirement for JavaScript access
2. Comprehensive mitigating controls
3. Industry-standard practice for CSRF protection
4. Overall security posture improvement

### Security Review Recommendations

When reviewing DAST findings:
1. Acknowledge the CSRF token cookie limitation
2. Verify all mitigating controls are in place
3. Confirm other cookies are properly secured
4. Document the security trade-off rationale

## Configuration Verification

To verify cookie security configuration:

```bash
# Check authentication in production
curl -I https://workouttracker.online/Account/Login

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://workouttracker.online/ | grep -E "(Content-Security-Policy|X-Frame-Options|X-XSS-Protection)"

# Test cookie settings (browser developer tools)
# Look for __Host- prefixed cookies in Application tab
```

## Updates and Maintenance

This configuration should be reviewed:
- When DAST findings are reported
- During security audits
- When upgrading .NET Core versions
- When modifying authentication flows
