# Cookie Security Configuration

## Overview

This document explains the cookie security measures implemented in WorkoutTracker to address DAST findings regarding cookies missing HttpOnly flags.

## Security Challenge

DAST tools identified that the CSRF token cookie has `HttpOnly = false`, which is flagged as a security vulnerability. However, this is a necessary configuration for anti-forgery protection in AJAX-heavy applications.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Cookie Configuration Enhancements

#### Authentication Cookie (`__Host-WorkoutTracker.Auth`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements

#### Session Cookie (`__Host-WorkoutTracker.Session`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements

#### CSRF Token Cookie (`__Host-CSRF-TOKEN`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access for enhanced XSS protection
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in production - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements
- **Expiration**: 12 hours - Minimizes exposure window

#### TempData Cookie (`__Host-WorkoutTracker.TempData`)
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access (XSS protection)
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure**: `Always` in all environments - Requires HTTPS
- **Prefix**: `__Host-` in production - Enhanced security requirements
- **Expiration**: 20 minutes - Short-lived for temporary data
- **IsEssential**: `true` - Required for application functionality

### 2. Cookie Prefix Security

The `__Host-` prefix provides additional security guarantees:
- Cookie must be sent over HTTPS
- Cookie must have the `Secure` flag set
- Cookie must not have a `Domain` attribute
- Cookie must have a `Path` attribute with the value `/`

### 3. Mitigating Controls for CSRF Token Exposure

While the CSRF token must be accessible to JavaScript, we implement multiple layers of protection:

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict script sources to prevent malicious script injection
- No `'unsafe-eval'` to prevent dynamic code execution
- Restricted inline scripts to minimize XSS attack surface

#### Additional Security Headers
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Legacy browser XSS protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: `SAMEORIGIN` - Prevents clickjacking
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

#### Cache Control for Sensitive Pages
- Authentication pages have strict cache control
- Prevents sensitive data from being cached
- Reduces token exposure in browser cache

### 4. Rate Limiting Cookie

The rate limiting cookie is properly secured:
- **HttpOnly**: `true`
- **SameSite**: `Lax`
- **Secure**: Based on environment
- **IsEssential**: `true`

## Risk Assessment

### CSRF Token Security Enhancement

**Update**: The CSRF token cookie now has `HttpOnly = true` to prevent JavaScript access
**Implementation**: All AJAX requests retrieve the token from hidden form fields (`__RequestVerificationToken`) rather than cookies
**Security Benefits**:
1. Enhanced protection against XSS attacks
2. Maintains robust anti-forgery protection
3. Complies with security best practices
4. Eliminates need for security trade-off
5. Additional protections remain in place:
   - Strict Content Security Policy
   - SameSite=Strict to prevent cross-site request forgery
   - Secure flag for HTTPS-only transmission
   - Short expiration (12 hours) minimizes exposure window
   - `__Host-` prefix provides additional security guarantees

**Conclusion**: The application has been updated to follow security best practices while maintaining full functionality.

## Compliance Notes

### DAST Tool Findings Resolution

The CSRF token cookie now has the HttpOnly flag set, which resolves the security finding previously reported by DAST tools. This change:

1. Eliminates the XSS risk previously associated with the CSRF token cookie
2. Maintains full application functionality by using form fields for token access
3. Follows security best practices for cookie configuration
4. Improves overall security posture

### Security Review Recommendations

When reviewing security findings:
1. Verify all cookies have HttpOnly flag set where appropriate
2. Confirm all mitigating controls remain in place
3. Ensure other cookies maintain proper security configuration
4. Document security improvements and their impact on application functionality

## Configuration Verification

To verify cookie security configuration:

```bash
# Check authentication in production
curl -I https://workouttracker.online/Account/Login

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://workouttracker.online/ | grep -E "(Content-Security-Policy|X-Frame-Options|X-XSS-Protection)"

# Test cookie settings (browser developer tools)
# Look for __Host- prefixed cookies in Application tab
```

## Updates and Maintenance

This configuration should be reviewed:
- When DAST findings are reported
- During security audits
- When upgrading .NET Core versions
- When modifying authentication flows
