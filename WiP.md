## Next Steps

### 2. Guest Access

- Update API documentation with new endpoints

## Technical Notes
- Token validation uses a combination of database checks and caching for performance
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks at 10 attempts per minute by default
  - Trusted IPs can be whitelisted to bypass rate limiting via admin panel
  - IP whitelist is persisted to disk and loaded on application startup
- Cache invalidation occurs on token update, delete and revoke operations
- Permission checks provide granular access control for different features
- IP tracking enables security auditing and rate limiting by client
- Cookie-based token persistence improves user experience during navigation
- Reports view uses the same visualization components as the main application but with read-only data
- User interface leverages Bootstrap modals for management actions
- No AJAX is used in the token management UI for simplified interaction
- Session dropdown provides quick selection for session-specific sharing
