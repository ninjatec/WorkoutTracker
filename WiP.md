# ShareToken Implementation Progress Document

## Completed Work

### 1. ShareToken Model & Database Implementation
- Implemented `ShareToken` model with properties for token security, expiration, and access controls
- Added properties for granular permissions (session, report, calculator access)
- Implemented usage tracking with access count and optional maximum limit
- Added relationships to User (creator) and optional Session (for specific sharing)
- Created necessary database migrations

### 2. ShareToken API Endpoints
- Created `ShareTokenController` with RESTful API endpoints:
  - GET /api/ShareToken - Get all user's tokens
  - GET /api/ShareToken/{id} - Get specific token
  - POST /api/ShareToken - Create new token
  - POST /api/ShareToken/validate - Validate token
  - GET /api/ShareToken/validate/{permission} - Check specific permission
  - PUT /api/ShareToken/{id} - Update token
  - DELETE /api/ShareToken/{id} - Delete token
  - POST /api/ShareToken/{id}/revoke - Revoke token (soft delete)

### 3. DTO Implementation
- Created `ShareTokenDto` for data transfer
- Implemented request models: `CreateShareTokenRequest`, `UpdateShareTokenRequest`
- Created validation models: `ShareTokenValidationRequest`, `ShareTokenValidationResponse`
- Added data annotations for request validation

### 4. Service Layer
- Implemented `IShareTokenService` interface
- Created `ShareTokenService` with CRUD operations and token validation
- Implemented secure token generation using `RandomNumberGenerator`
- Added token validation logic with expiration and usage limit checks

### 5. Security Enhancements
- Created `TokenRateLimiter` using token bucket algorithm to prevent brute force attacks
- Implemented `TokenValidationService` with caching and IP-based rate limiting
- Created `ShareTokenAuthorizeAttribute` for controller/action authorization
- Implemented `ShareTokenExtensions` for easy token retrieval from `HttpContext`
- Added cache invalidation for token modifications

### 6. Integration
- Registered services in DI container in `Program.cs`
- Updated documentation in README.md and inventory.md
- Updated SoW.md to mark completed tasks

### 7. Shared Workout Controllers & Views
- Created `SharedController` for rendering user-facing views:
  - Implemented session listing page for shared workouts
  - Added detailed session view with sets and reps
  - Created read-only reports page for shared access
- Created `SharedWorkoutController` for API access:
  - Added REST endpoints for shared workout data
  - Implemented permission-based access control
  - Protected all endpoints with `ShareTokenAuthorize` attribute
- Implemented token validation for all shared access
- Added cookie-based token persistence for better UX
- Created custom `_SharedLayout.cshtml` with token status display
- Fixed type conversion issues between nullable and non-nullable types in data queries

### 8. Read-Only Reports Implementation
- Created dedicated read-only reports view for shared access
- Implemented permission checking for reports access
- Added visualization components with Chart.js
- Created filtered data access for shared reports
- Implemented exercise performance metrics for shared view
- Added success/failure tracking visualization

### 9. User Management Interface
- Created `ShareTokens.cshtml` and `ShareTokens.cshtml.cs` in Account/Manage area
- Implemented user interface for token management with:
  - Token listing with status indicators (active, expired, revoked)
  - Token creation form with configurable settings:
    - Expiration period selection (1-365 days)
    - Session-specific or account-wide sharing option
    - Optional usage limits with maximum access count
    - Granular permission controls for various features
    - Custom naming and description fields
  - Token management actions:
    - View token details with shareable link
    - Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy sharing
    - Edit token settings (permissions, expiry, limits)
    - Revoke tokens without deletion (maintains history)
    - Permanently delete tokens
  - Visual status indicators for token information:
    - Color-coded status badges
    - Expiration countdown display
    - Usage statistics with remaining uses counter
    - Permission indicators for feature access
- Added `_StatusMessage.cshtml` partial view for user feedback
- Extended `UserService` with `GetUserSessionsAsync` method for session dropdown
- Updated account management navigation to include Share Tokens page
- Implemented security features:
  - Secure URL generation with scheme and host
  - User validation for token ownership
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 10. Hangfire Server Components Separation
- Created `HangfireServerConfiguration` class to centralize server settings
- Implemented role-based initialization for processing vs. non-processing nodes
- Updated `AlertingJobsRegistration` to support worker/application role separation
- Modified Program.cs to conditionally enable Hangfire processing based on configuration
- Added dedicated worker pod deployment configuration for Kubernetes
- Created diagnostic UI for monitoring server configuration and role
- Updated appsettings.json with Hangfire-specific configuration section
- Added environment variable support for Kubernetes deployment
- Added documentation for Hangfire worker setup

## Next Steps

### 2. Guest Access
- Create anonymous access mechanism
- Implement session tracking for guest users
- Add conversion path from guest to registered user

### 3. Final Documentation
- Create user guide for workout data sharing
- Update API documentation with new endpoints

## Technical Notes
- Token validation uses a combination of database checks and caching for performance
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks at 10 attempts per minute by default
- Cache invalidation occurs on token update, delete and revoke operations
- Permission checks provide granular access control for different features
- IP tracking enables security auditing and rate limiting by client
- Cookie-based token persistence improves user experience during navigation
- Reports view uses the same visualization components as the main application but with read-only data
- User interface leverages Bootstrap modals for management actions
- No AJAX is used in the token management UI for simplified interaction
- Session dropdown provides quick selection for session-specific sharing
