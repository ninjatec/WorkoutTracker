# WorkoutTracker Performance and Stability Optimization

## Statement of Work

This document outlines the performance and stability optimization tasks for the WorkoutTracker application, structured as actionable tasks with specific implementation details.

## Database Optimization Tasks

### DB-01: Optimize Database Connection Pooling
[x] Adjust maximum pool size from 100/200 to a more appropriate value based on deployment scale (suggest 50-75)
[x] Refactor connection string builders to use consistent pool sizing across application
[x] Implement connection health monitoring with metrics for pool utilization
[x] Create dashboard widget for connection pool statistics
[x] Add configuration for separate read/write connection pools with different settings]

### DB-02: Implement Query Result Caching
[x] Create a QueryResultCacheService with Redis/in-memory fallback
[x] Implement cache invalidation triggers for database changes
[x] Add cache configuration options in appsettings.json
[x] Cache frequently accessed, rarely changing data (exercise types, workout templates)
[x] Add instrumentation to measure cache hit/miss rates

### DB-03: Optimize Entity Framework Tracking
[x] Audit and update Entity Framework tracking behavior for all repositories
[x] Create a tracking strategy implementation for read vs write operations
[x] Add custom conventions for change tracking to ignore unnecessary fields
[x] Implement explicit entity inclusion/exclusion for complex aggregates

### DB-04: Optimize N+1 Query Patterns
[x] Identify and fix N+1 query patterns in workout session retrieval
[x] Review and optimize eager loading strategies across application
[x] Implement batch fetching for collections where appropriate
[x] Add compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
[x] Create custom ProjectTo mappings to minimize data transfer

### DB-05: Complete Session to WorkoutSession Migration
[x] Remove any remaining Session models and table references
[x] Update all remaining components to exclusively use WorkoutSession
[x] Refactor volume calculation services for the new data model
[x] Create and execute cleanup migration script
[x] Update documentation to reflect completed migration

## Redis Enhancement Tasks

### RD-01: Implement Redis Circuit Breaker
[ ] Create dedicated RedisCircuitBreakerService as wrapper for Redis operations
[ ] Add exponential back-off for Redis connection failures
[ ] Implement fallback to in-memory alternatives during Redis outages

### RD-02: Optimize Redis Key Strategies
[ ] Audit current Redis key usage for optimization opportunities
[ ] Implement consistent key naming convention and documentation
[ ] Add appropriate TTL for different categories of cached data

### RD-03: Enhance Output Cache Policies
[ ] Implement cache invalidation hooks for entity changes
[ ] Add cache partitioning for better isolation and expiration control
[ ] Create anti-dogpile locking mechanism for high-concurrency keys
[ ] Integrate background refresh for about-to-expire popular content

## Application Performance Tasks

### AP-01: Optimize SignalR Implementation
[ ] Implement message batching for high-frequency updates
[ ] Create error handling and reconnection strategies for client disconnects
[ ] Optimize connection lifetime for mobile clients to reduce resource usage

### AP-02: Implement Response Compression
[ ] Add response compression middleware with Brotli/Gzip support
[ ] Configure compression for JSON, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML responses
[ ] Add cache-control headers for compressed static assets
[ ] Create compression exclusion list for already compressed content
[ ] Add compression analytics to track bandwidth savings
### AP-03: Optimize API Endpoints
[ ] Implement ETags for cacheable API resources
[ ] Add pagination improvements for reporting endpoints
[ ] Create response envelope with metadata for complex data structures
[ ] Optimize serialization settings for JSON responses
[ ] Add conditional request processing for large result sets

### AP-04: Enhance Background Job Processing
[ ] Add retry backoff strategy for failing jobs
[ ] Improve job continuation patterns for complex workflows
[ ] Add job storage cleanup and maintenance routines

### AP-05: Optimize Frontend Asset Delivery
[ ] Add browser caching headers for static assets
[ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical JavaScript
[ ] Create bundled and minified asset pipeline for production
[ ] Implement critical CSS path optimization
[ ] Add image optimization and lazy loading for workout images
